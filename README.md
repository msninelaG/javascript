About this Repo
Here I am covering basics on Javascript, within this content, and sequentially,

- Variables and Array
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditionals

Please go through these files, in this order.

You will notice that on index html file, I have commented out some execution of other scripts,

    <!script src="Variables_and_DataType.js"></script>
    <!script src="Arrays.js"></script>
    <!script src="Loops.js"><!script>
    <!script src="Conditionals.js"></script>
    <script src="Objects.js"></script>
	
You, please when you check this out to your working environment, you can uncomment the script you want to execute.

Do not worry about styling (style.css) I used, not unless you want to learn CSS as well, then you can pay attention to it.

What is to follow?

One of the most important aspects in running Javascripts is EVENTS, because Javascript was created
to make web pages interactive and dynamic. In order to do that, you need to have some kind of events handling
- Fo click
- For scroll
- For drag, and whatever the case may be. 

Therefore, what I will add next will be EVENTS.
